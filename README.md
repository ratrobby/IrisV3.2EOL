# MRLF Repo

This repository contains device classes and GUI tools for the MRLF project. The repository layout is organised as follows:

```
MRLF Repo/
├── devices/         # Device class modules
├── gui/             # GUI applications
├── config/          # JSON configuration files
├── logs/            # Test run logs
├── decorators.py
├── IO_master.py
└── README.md
```

`gui/TestLauncher.py` lets you map devices and create or load tests. Enter a test name, configure the mapping and click **Create New Test** to launch the Test Wizard. Test folders are created inside `~/MRLF Tests` by default (or the location specified in the `MRLF_TEST_DIR` environment variable) and any logs or scripts are written there. The launcher replaces the previous `ConfigureTestCell.py` tool.

Calibration values for position sensors are stored in the file specified by the
`MRLF_CALIBRATION_FILE` environment variable. The Test Wizard automatically sets
this variable to `<TestFolder>/sensor_calibrations.json` when a test starts so
each test keeps its own calibration data. If the variable is not set, the
default `config/sensor_calibrations.json` path in the repository root is used.

`gui/TestWizard.py` now supports a generic calibration wizard. Any device
implementing a `calibration_steps()` class method will show a **Calibrate…**
button in the Test Wizard setup panel. Clicking the button launches a wizard
that walks through the defined steps.

The standalone PySimpleGUI tool for calibrating all
`PositionSensorSDATMHS_M160` devices is still available:

```bash
python -m gui.sensor_calibration_psg
```

## Dependencies

The core utilities rely on a few external Python packages:

- **PySimpleGUI** – required for the GUI calibration tools.
- **pyModbusTCP** – provides Modbus client communication.

Install them with pip:

```bash
pip install PySimpleGUI pyModbusTCP
```

Some functionality can use additional packages. For example the
`PressureRegulatorITV1050` device will take advantage of `scipy` for smoother
interpolation if it is installed:

```bash
pip install scipy  # optional
```
