# MRLF Repo

This repository contains device classes and GUI tools for the MRLF project. The repository layout has been reorganized as follows:

```
MRLF Repo/
├── devices/         # Device class modules
├── gui/             # GUI applications
├── config/          # JSON configuration files
├── logs/            # Test run logs
├── decorators.py
├── IO_master.py
└── README.md
```

`gui/ConfigureTestCell.py` provides a GUI to configure a test cell and generate device mapping scripts. `gui/TestWizard.py` is a placeholder for future test execution tools.
